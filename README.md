# trackball-mousekeys

Use the keyboard as mousekeys for a trackball

I bought a ploppy nano trackball ( https://ploopy.co/nano-trackball/ ) but I didn't realize that I need mousekeys too :)

This little tool tries to solve this problem by using the trackball as a mouse and the keyboard as mousekeys.

## How it works

As soon as you move the trackball a yellow circle will show up around your mouse cursor.

While the circle is visible you can press the following keys to trigger mouse actions:

- q: double left click
- a: left mouse click
- s: middle mouse click
- d: right mouse click
- w: mouse wheel up
- r: mouse wheel down
- y: left mouse down / up (useful for dragging)
- c: right mouse down / up (useful for dragging)

Pressing f while the yellow circle is active will lock the mouse mode.
The circle will turn blue and will stay active. This indicates that the a,s and d keys will continue to work until you unlock the mouse mode again with f.

At any time when the yellow or blue circles are active you can press space to end mouse mode immediately.
