# trackball-mousekeys

Use the keyboard as mousekeys for a trackball

## How it works

As soon as you move the trackball a yellow circle will show up around your mouse cursor.

While the circle is visible you can press the following keys to trigger mouse actions:

- a: left mouse click
- s: middle mouse click
- d: right mouse click
- q,w: mouse wheel up
- e,r: mouse wheel down
- y: left mouse down / up (useful for dragging)
- c: right mouse down / up (useful for dragging)

Pressing f while the yellow circle is active will lock the mouse mode.
The circle will turn blue and stays active. This indicates that the a,s and d keys will continue to work until you unlock the mouse mode again with f.

At any time when the yellow or blue circles are active you can press space to end mouse mode immediately.
